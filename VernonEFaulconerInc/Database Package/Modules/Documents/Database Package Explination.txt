	└── Database Control.py

This collection of programs and files is used to update the Microsoft Access and SQL Server databases that receive information from Drilling Info.

The primary way this is accomplished is through a collection of python files that can run together using "Database Control.py" or individually using their respective programs. For information on the programs, check their individual READ ME(s) and the "Master READ ME.txt" in the Documents folder.

If a document or folder does not have a description in the Documents folder it will be explained here.


*** Folders:

@ Database Package:

	"Database Package" contains all programs and folders needed to maintain the databases as well as pull and input all data received into those databases. 

@ Modules:

	Modules contains all of the pieces to allow Database Control to operate properly. These range from separate programs, to text files, to excel documents that work together behind the scenes. 

@ Documents:

	The documents folder contains all documentation explaining the workings of the different programs save for the first "READ ME".

@ In Depth Documents:

	This folder holds all of the more complex documents related to the programs. It is used to keep the m separate so they are not confused.

@ __pycache__:

	This folder is generated by python whenever the individual programs are called as modules. It is not something to try to mess with. If as file is deleted, python will generate another one so there is no need to edit it or its contents.


*** Files:

@ READ ME(s):

	These files will give descriptions of their respective programs. There will be a high level versions and those that will get into more of the coding descriptions for each. This is done so that those who do not code often can still understand what is happening and those who do can understand the structure of the programs themselves. The ones that go deeper begin with "ID" for In Depth.

@ Monthly Status Update:

	This document aids in the addition of data to the Access database and in turn the SQL database. The specifics of how to use it are explained in the Database documentation file. There, steps can be found on how to use it. The StatusUpdate.py file will also walk a user step by step through how to use it. The file itself is broken into sections that do multiple different functions. These functions sift and organize the data to be easily transferred to Access.

@ Final Database Documentation:

	This file describes the different components of the Access Database in terms of tables, queues, and forms. It also discusses how to properly maintain the database to ensure that it remains functional.

@ Steps to Install Python:

	This file will walk the reader through how to install python as well as what libraries need to be installed in order for the programs to function properly.
