Documentation for ToFlatFile.py

This program aids in the process of creating a flat file to be added into ARIES. 

To start there are two menus that allow the user to select a range of dates they would like to download.

After selecting the dates the program will pull the required records from Access and write them to the MonthlyFlatFile.csv file.
