 In Depth Documentation for Database Control.py

This program coordinates all the others. While they can be run individually, running this program makes it easy to run one or multiple. 

This is a relatively short program that consists of a single menu. Through the options it can run either UpdateDatabase.py and/or StatusUpdate.py programs or open a collection of other documents. Those documents are the Access Database, Monthly Status excel sheet, Package READ ME, Database Control READ ME, and the Database Documentation file.

The only library used is the os library to open files. In terms of modules it uses the following:
	LoginCredentials
	UpdateDatabase
	StatusUpdate
	toFlatFile
